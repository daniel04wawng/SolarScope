# SolarScope

SolarScope enables users to visualize futuristic, eco-friendly building designs in their real-world surroundings through Augmented Reality (AR). By using their smartphone, users can place a 3D model of an advanced architectural structure in their environment and explore it in an immersive way. The app also provides detailed solar energy insights, helping users understand energy savings and cost efficiency. This interactive experience fosters creativity, allowing architects and engineers to refine designs that align with their project's vision and sustainability goals.
